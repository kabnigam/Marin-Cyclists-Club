          All routes (with the exception of the Mt. Tam Century) have an option to bail out so riders can shorten their ride back to the finish. We say this so you know there is a parachute. However, we encourage you to ride the furthest distance you feel you can in order to give you a sense of achievement.

        <h4>Route Descriptions</h4>
        <p>
          <b>50K/35 MILE COURSE</b><br><br> YOU SHOULD BE EXPERIENCED AND REASONABLY FIT TO ATTEMPT THIS RIDE.  Although not as long or difficult as the other courses available, the 50k does have ONE SIGNIFICANT CLIMB ON LUCAS VALLEY ROAD WITH NARROW SHOULDERS AND STEEP GRADES.  IF RIDING WITH YOUNGER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY, PLEASE EXERCISE YOUR BEST JUDGMENT REGARDING THEIR ABILITIES.  While we attempt to provide a challenging course, we do not guarantee the road condition on the day of the ride.  THERE CAN BE GRAVEL, ROCKS AND GLASS ON THE ROAD.  YOU MAY BE RIDING WITH CARS AND OTHER BIKES THAT ARE BEING OPERATED RECKLESSLY.  Any rider seen to be operating their bike unsafely in any way, can and will be pulled from the ride and disqualified.  You must have safe control of your bike at all times.  EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN DESCENDING ON YOU RETURN ON LUCAS VALLEY ROAD.
          <br><br>

          The Marin Half Metric Century route begins on flat to rolling terrain before you are greeted with your first challenge of the day, a 1.5 mile and 430 foot climb to the Big Rock summit of Lucas Valley. This is followed by a thrilling descent through the redwoods into the ranches and grasslands of West Marin. The route then winds north through relatively flat terrain past the small town of Nicasio . Just past Nicasio Square is the 1st Rest Stop at the Nicasio School (opposite side of the road) at mile 12.
          <br><br>

          The route then continues alongside Nicasio Reservoir to the junction of the Pt. Reyes – Petaluma Rd. at mile 16 where the course turns around and backtracks to the finish. Of course, you are welcome to stop again at the Nicasio School Rest Stop before you begin your climb back up Lucas Valley Rd. to Big Rock.
          <br><br>

          The course finishes by reversing Lucas Valley Rd (it is an easier climb this direction). BE VERY CAREFUL DESCENDING FROM BIG ROCK AT LUCAS VALLEY ROAD . THIS DESCENT HAS SEVERAL SHARP LEFT HAND TURNS WITH A DECREASING RADIUS – GO VERY SLOWLY!! It is almost all downhill from there until you arrive back at the Start/Finish at the MARIN COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS.

        </p>
        <p>
          <b>100K/63 MILE COURSE (METRIC CENTURY)</b><br><br> YOU SHOULD BE TRAINED AND FIT TO ATTEMPT ANY OF THESE RIDES. THIS COURSE INCLUDE STEEP UPHILL CLIMBS AND STEEP TECHNICAL DESCENTS. WHILE YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE AN EXPERT CYCLIST, THESE COURSES ARE NOT FOR BEGINNERS. WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE A CHALLENGING COURSE, WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE ROAD CONDITION ON THE DAY OF THE RIDE. THERE CAN BE GRAVEL, ROCKS AND GLASS ON THE ROAD. YOU MAY BE RIDING WITH CARS AND OTHER BIKES THAT ARE BEING OPERATED RECKLESSLY. ANY RIDER SEEN TO BE OPERATING THEIR BIKE UNSAFELY IN ANY WAY, CAN AND WILL BE PULLED FROM THE RIDE AND DISQUALIFIED. YOU MUST HAVE SAFE CONTROL OF YOUR BIKE AT ALL TIMES.  EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN DESCENDING ON YOUR RETURN ON LUCAS VALLEY ROAD.

          <br><br>

          The 2nd climb of the day (1.4 miles and 380 foot gain) rolls up the Pt. Reyes-Petaluma Rd. over a summit and past the famous Cheese Factory.  You then continue to your 3rd climb up “Red Hill”, followed by a quick and curvy descent into the outskirts of Petaluma to the 2nd Rest Stop Petaluma Junior High School (Mile 29).    Hydrate and calorie up at this rest stop. After resting your bones on the sunny grass, you will roll along relatively flat terrain to the biggest challenge of the day-- Wilson Hill. This climb is steep, 700’ high and the descent down the west side exhilarating.  But control your speed, as you will make a 90 degree left at the bottom, as the ride continues along Hicks Valley Rd. This is remote west Marin at its best. Rolling hills and sparsely traveled roads bring you through ranch country and open space to where the 100K route turns west on the Pt. Reyes-Petaluma Rd. , as you return past the Cheese Factory.  Enjoy another slight climb and then a very fast descent to Nicasio Reservoir and Nicasio Valley Rd. This relatively flat stretch will lead you a couple more miles to your 3rd and final rest stop in the town of Nicasio at mile 45.9.
          <br><br>

          The course finishes by reversing Lucas Valley Rd (it is an easier climb this direction). BE VERY CAREFUL DESCENDING FROM BIG ROCK AT LUCAS VALLEY ROAD . THIS DESCENT HAS SEVERAL SHARP LEFT HAND TURNS WITH A DECREASING RADIUS – GO VERY SLOWLY!! It is almost all downhill from there until you arrive back at the Start/Finish at the MARIN COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS.

          The Marin Metric Century route begins on flat to rolling terrain before you are greeted with your first challenge of the day, a 1.5 mile and 430 foot climb to the Big Rock summit of Lucas Valley . This is followed by a thrilling descent through the redwoods into the ranches and grasslands of West Marin. The route then winds north through relatively flat terrain past the small town of Nicasio and alongside Nicasio Reservoir.

You then continue to your 3rd climb up “Red Hill”, followed by a quick and curvy descent into the outskirts of Petaluma to the 2nd Rest Stop Petaluma Junior High School (Mile 29).    Refuled, you will roll out to Chilleno Valley Road . This road is one of the club favorites. The remote terrain is great for pace lines too. Ride on through relatively flat terrain (ok, it’s really more rollers…) and country roads to Tomales Petaluma Rd to Tomales. A left turn onto Dillon Beach Road takes  you to moderate climb along Whitaker Bluff and leads you onto the remote Franklin School – Valley Ford Rd., up and over one last ridge north, past the halfway point for the day, to your 3rd Rest Stop at Valley Ford at mile 57.4 The Valley Ford Rest Stop is well stocked to sate your hunger and quench your thirst.
          <br><br>

          The ride resumes over scenic and sparsely traveled country hills and roads (the short but steep Middle Road climb will get your attention), as you make your way back to Tomales and 7 miles of rolling terrain on highway 1 alongside Tomales Bay .  Watch for the sharp left turn undefined be sure to check for cars in both directions--onto Marshall-Petaluma Road (mile 71.8) and immediately begin a steep 700 foot stairstep climb up the infamous “Marshall Wall” (the “back way”).   From the ridge you will be treated to spectacular views back down into the sweeping grassland hills of Marin. Behind to the west, the world drops away to Tomales Bay , Pt. Reyes National Seashore and the Pacific Ocean. The descent down the east side of the Marshall Wall is steep and exhilarating, leading you to the well deserved Walker Creek rest stop at mile 77.9.

          The way back is fast and fun, as the ride continues along Hicks Valley Rd. This is remote west Marin at its best.

          ALL DOUBLE METRIC RIDERS NEED TO SIGN IN AT THE BAY HILL COLEMAN LOOP CHECKPOINT AFTER LEAVING THE VALLEY FORD REST STOP. HARD CUTOFF TIME IS 3:30.  We do not want to go looking for you on the loop if you are happily on your way to Petaluma ! RIDERS MUST DEPART THE VALLEY FORD REST STOP BY  3:30PM TO BEGIN THE COLEMAN VALLEY LOOP.  AFTER 3:30PM, RIDERS WILL BE DIVERTED SOUTH.

          While the century riders are starting to head back south, you are about to taste some of the best hill climbs anywhere. The climb up Bay Hill Rd. is beautiful with grand vistas of the Pacific once you have earned the crest.  It is a quick descent (rough road) to Hwy 1 for some very scenic miles of coastline before turning onto Coleman Valley Rd. Coleman Valley Rd. is the big climb of the 200 K course. With 68 miles on your legs, the climb is long and steep with false summits and huge views. Be sure to look south from the top. At the edge of the horizon you will see Mt Tam! This is one for the books. Remember to smile! This will forever be one of your favorites!
          <br><br>
          At the top of the Coleman Valley Loop, mile 73.8, you will find a “Mini Rest Stop” stocked with water, Gatorade and energy supplements (gels, bars, etc). This stop will not have the usual array of fruit and other foods you may be used to but you will find those down the road a few more miles at Valley Ford.
          <br><br>

          The top of the Coleman Valley Loop undulates with a 400 ft descent in the middle before climbing right back up (gotta love that!). The final descent on remote Joy Rd  is very big and long, and the two lane road narrows in places, so watch for the occasional oncoming vehicle as you negotiate some fast curves. Be aware that this road can be rough with large potholes and cracks. USE EXTREME CAUTION. Wide shouldered roads take you back to your 4th Rest Stop in Valley Ford (Déjà vu) at mile 87. BE SURE TO SIGN BACK IN.
