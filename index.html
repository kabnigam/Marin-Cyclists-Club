      <h3>Who We Are</h3>
      <p>
        Marin Cyclists is a nonprofit club dedicated to helping cyclists meet up to experience the wonders of riding in Marin County and the surrounding Bay Area.<br>
        We offer organized rides during the weekend and shorter, informal rides during the week as well as a speaker series and social gatherings off the bike. <br>
        Our signature event is the annual Marin Century and Mt. Tam Double Century, which together offer 3,000 cyclists an epic day in the saddle, a highly rated after party, and the opportunity to support some deserving local organizations.<br>
        Our members have a wide range of abilities and ambitions and are invited to share their expertise as well as leadership skills.
