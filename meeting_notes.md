The following copy is proposed:

Marin Cyclists is a nonprofit club dedicated to helping cyclists meet up to experience the wonders of riding in Marin County and the surrounding Bay Area. We offer organized rides during the weekend and shorter, informal rides during the week as well as a speaker series and social gatherings off the bike. Our signature event is the annual Marin Century and Mt. Tam Double Century, which together offer 3,000 cyclists an epic day in the saddle, a highly rated after party, and the opportunity to support some deserving local organizations. Our members have a wide range of abilities and ambitions and are invited to share their expertise as well as leadership skills.
